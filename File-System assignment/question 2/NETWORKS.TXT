1. MS-DOS Shell and Networks
============================
Most network software won't work correctly if you start it from a
command prompt in MS-DOS Shell. Start your network before starting
MS-DOS Shell.

2. 3+Share
==========
If your network software is 3+Share version 1.6, and you have the
redirector included with MS-DOS 5.0, your current version of the
3+Share redirector will work with MS-DOS 6.21. After you install
MS-DOS 6.21, type the following at the command prompt, and restart
your computer:

   SETVER MSREDIR.EXE 5.0

If you do not have the redirector included with MS-DOS 5.0, check to
see if your version of MS-DOS 6.21 included a NET.TXT file. If so,
follow the instructions in that file.

If your version of MS-DOS 6.21 did not include a NET.TXT file, obtain
the redirector by ordering the Supplemental disks or by downloading
the disks from the Microsoft Product Support Download Service (MSDL).
For more information, see the coupon at the back of the MICROSOFT
MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE. After you obtain the redirector, follow the
instructions in the NET.TXT file on the Supplemental disks.

If you have 3+Share version earlier than 1.6, contact your network
vendor for an update.

3. Arcnet systems
=================
If your network uses Arcnet hardware, you might need to run the
Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD) program by using the MSD /I command.
If you must use the /I switch, do not c
